Pseudo code:

Procedure: Human palmvein Verification
Input: Palm vein image, I
Output: Authenticate a person as Genuine or Imposter.

/*Initialization*/
/* ROI extraction */
CI = Crop(I)
RI = Resize(CI) // resized to 150 x150

/* Feature Extraction * /
// Convolve grayscale image using gabor_filter
GT = convolve(RI, Gabor_filter);

// To extract the feature apply standard deviation to Gabor Template
Fee = standard_deviation(GT);

/*ADC extraction */
// Extract the direction code (dc) from the Gabor Template (GT) and apply minimum function to dc to extract the Apparent Direction Code(ADC)

ADC = min(dc)

// By Convolving ADC using gabor filter Energy Map of Apparent Direction Code is extracted

EADC = convolve(ADC, Gabor_Filter);

// By Convolving EADC using gabor template Latent Direction Code is Extracted

LDC = convolve(EADC, GT);

/* Apparent and Latent Direction Code */

// Apply Multiplication Scheme to ADC and LDC to get Apparent and Latent Direction Code

ALDC = ADC * LDC;

/* Final Feature Extraction */

fee1 = standard_deviation(ALDC);

// Apply addition scheme
Finalarray = add(fee, fee1)

/* Feature Matching*/

// Find the correlation between the extracted feature and given person number

Match = correlation(Finalarray, Person number)

if match == 0.9998
“Genuine person“;
else
“Imposter person “
end
